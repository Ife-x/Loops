# Loops

Loops can be used in python to indicate a repeated process. Their are two types FOR and WHILE loops.
The FOR loop is often used when you usually know how many times you would like the program, which means it will run that program until the number of times is complete before it terminates itself. The WHILE loop works in a similar manner but requires a conditional statement. Benefit of the WHILE loop is when you are unsure how many iterations are required to complete the given expression.
